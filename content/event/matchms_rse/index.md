I have an open position for the next 3-year development phase of our open-source Python libraries for analyzing mass spectrometry data!

If you are into Python software development and looking to apply your skills to empower researchers in biological and biomedical fields by creating novel, better, more user-friendly tools, this might be for you.

**OR**, if you come from a biological and biomedical background (ideally related to mass spectral or other omics data), bring solid programming skills, and want to expand more into research software development, this might be for you, too.
